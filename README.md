# supervised_learning_eur_2020

This repository contains the implementation of many supervised learning algorithms from scratch.
The codes are implemented  based on the course Supervised Learning by Dr. Patrick Van Groenen and Dr. Pieter Schoonees in Erasmus University

Code 1:
A2_mm_cv_Ibrahim.R contains the elastic net regression with a Majorization and Minimization algorithm (MM). Note that for this implementation, the lecture notes of Patrick van Groenen were of great help.

Code 2: 
Kernel Ridge Regression - Radial Basis function (RBF) and non homogenous polynomial kernels
This code implements various Kernel Ridge regression, with cross-validation. 

Code 3:
A_4_svm_mm.R contains the Support Vector Machine implementation from scratch. Optimization is based on Majorization algorithm
It can handle non-linear Kernels such as Radial Basis Functions, Non-homogenous Polynomials. Finally it does cross validation and grid search to find optimal parameters. Finally, it also contains the confusion matrix for method diagnostic purposes.
