# supervised_learning_eur_2020

This repository contains the implementation of many supervised learning algorithms from scratch.
The codes are implemented  based on the course Supervised Learning by Dr. Patrick Van Groenen and Dr. Pieter Schoonees in Erasmus University

1st implementation:
A2_mm_cv_Ibrahim.R contains the elastic net regression with a Majorization and Minimization algorithm (MM). Note that for this implementation, the lecture notes of Patrick van Groenen were of great help.


2nd implementation: 
Kernel Ridge Regression - Radial Basis function (RBF) and non homogenous polynomial kernels
This code implements various Kernel Ridge regression, with cross-validation.
